# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project develops a Movie Recommendation System using collaborative filtering techniques, including Item-based &amp; User-based approaches, to recommend top 5 movies. It compares the accuracy and efficiency of various methodologies, using Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation, Standard Estimate, and SVD methods, and evaluates performance with MAE.
